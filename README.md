# Match four bot game

## Why?

This is a small idea to provide a fun little challenge for learning java and a bit of git.<br/>
Every one can clone the repository, create its own bot and challenge the other.
And if you like your bot, you can share it with others.

## How do I participate?

You need git and a java ide of your choice.
Just clone the repository, create a new java file for your bot in the bots folder and start coding.<br/>
If you like your creation, please share it with the other. Maybe someone can learn something from looking at your code.

## Rules

For cloning and playing with this local, there are no rules. Feel free to try out stuff and learn. <br/>
For pushing your bot into the repository there are some rules:
1. Please push no changes in files except of your bot. If you create a merge request with changes outside your bot, it will be refused.
2. You can give other Bots a look if you are searching for an idea, but do not copy any code from there into your bot.
3. Have fun

## How to clone the repository?

First you have to install git on your system if you don't have already. You can find it here: https://git-scm.com/downloads <br/>
If you are planning to share your bot, you have to fork the repository. That can be done in the upper right corner on the github page of this repository.
Then you can pull this repository by execute `git clone https://github.com/TazztheMonster/matchFour.git`. If you have a fork, just replace the domain with the link to your forked repository.<br/>
Not you can open the cloned repository with an ide of your choice and the coding can begin.

## How to create a bot?

That pretty simple. You only have to create a .java in the `matchFour/src/bots` folder and your class have to implement the `FourWinsBot` interface.
If you are stuck with these, take a look at the `exampleBot.java`.

## How to get my bot into this repository?

After you forked this repository, create your own bot and pushed your code into your repository, at your repository page should appear a `Compare & pull request` button.
With this you can create a pull request that I can merge into this repository by time.
